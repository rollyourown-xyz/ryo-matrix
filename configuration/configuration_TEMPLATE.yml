#-----------------------
# REQUIRED Configuration
#-----------------------

# Project configuration
#----------------------

# The project ID must be 15 characters or less and should be unique amongst
# projects. If this is changed, then the project directory name also needs to be 
# changed, e.g. via 'mv ryo-matrix <NEW_NAME>'
project_id: ryo-matrix

# Set the domain to be used for the project. The project will deploy a synapse home server
# to matrix.<DOMAIN> and an element web client to element.<DOMAIN>
# DNS A records for the following domains must be set to point to the public IPv4 address of
# your host server:
#   - <DOMAIN>
#   - matrix.<DOMAIN>
#   - element.<DOMAIN>
project_domain_name: <DOMAIN>

# Set the STUN/TURN server subdomain to be used for the project - for example coturn.{{project_domain_name}}
# The DNS A record for the project's STUN/TURN server domain must be set to point to the public IPv4 address
# of your host server
# If a STUN/TURN server has already been deployed (e.g. by a different rollyourown.xyz project), then enter
# the (sub-)domain used. Otherwise, this project will deploy the ryo-coturn module using this domain name
project_coturn_domain_name: <SUBDOMAIN>.<DOMAIN>

# Enter a username for the administrator of this project, 
# this will be used for logging in to the synapse-admin service for administering users
project_admin_username: <USERNAME>

# Enter a password for the administrator of this project.
# !!! The password should have a minimum of 12 characters with at least
# !!! 1 upper case character, 1 lower case character and 1 numerical digit
# This password will be the username and password for the synapse administrator account
project_admin_password: <PASSWORD>

# Enter an email address for the administrator of this project, 
# this will be used for letsencrypt certificates and for the keycloak and matrix services
project_admin_email: <EMAIL ADDRESS>

# SMTP Server settings
# An email server account is needed for sending user account emails (e.g. notifications) to 
# users of the matrix server deployed by the project. The parameters for the SMTP server should
# be available from your domain and email hosting provider
project_smtp_server: <SMTP SERVER NAME>
project_smtp_server_port: <PORT NUMBER>
project_smtp_server_starttls: <true OR false, depending on the SMTP server configuration>
project_smtp_server_ssl: <true OR false, depending on the SMTP server configuration>

# SMTP Account settings
# The user account for the SMTP server should be available from your domain and email hosting provider
project_smtp_server_username: <USERNAME>
project_smtp_server_password: <PASSWORD>

# Change the locales to be supported by the project's services if needed. Supported locales should be
# given in a list of ISO 639-1 locale codes, e.g. [ "en", "de", "fr", "es" ] and the default 
# locale should be one of the supported locales, e.g. "en"
project_locales: [ "en", "de", "fr", "es" ]
project_default_locale: en

# Change the default country code to use when showing country selectors (e.g. with phone number input in
# element-web). The country code should be an ISO 3166-1 alpha2 country code.
project_default_country_code: "GB"

# Change the room complexity value in case your server has low resources and you would like to limit the
# complexity of rooms on remote servers that users on your server are allowed to join
# The default value is significantly higher than some large rooms on the matrix.org server, so that it
# should effectively allow users to join almost any remote room.
# To block users (except for the project admin) from joining the largest rooms, reduce this value to `10`
# or further to increase the limitation
# From https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/sample_config.yaml
#
#   Resource-constrained homeserver settings
#   [...] the room "complexity" will be checked before a user joins a new remote room. If it is above
#   the complexity limit, the server will disallow joining, or will instantly leave.
#   Room complexity is an arbitrary measure based on factors such as the number of users in the room.
# 
project_matrix_room_complexity: 100



#-----------------------
# Optional Configuration
#-----------------------

# Footer links for web client login page
#---------------------------------------

# Add footer links on the login page of the element web matrix client
# Add further items to the list in the form shown
# Always leave AT LEAST ONE link in this list
element_footer_links:
  - text: "rollyourown.xyz"
    url: "https://rollyourown.xyz"
  #- text: "About"
  #  url: "https://example.com/about"
  #- text: "Privacy Policy"
  #  url: "https://example.com/privacy"


# Single Sign-On mode
#--------------------

# Identity provider selection for single sign-on (SSO)
# Change this parameter to select an external Identity and Access Management system for Matrix users.
# Depending on the choice here, add the respective variable configuration below.
# This variable **must** be set to one of the following values. Currently supported are:
#   - standalone  - no external IAM will be used. User accounts will be added to synapse directly
#                   via synapse-admin
#   - gitea       - a Gitea server will be used for IAM. User accounts are added to the Gitea
#                   server. Synapse users are authenticated via the Gitea server login.
#                   The ryo-gitea project should be deployed to the host server **before**
#                   deploying this project
project_idp_mode: standalone


# Single Sign-On - standalone mode
#---------------------------------

# There are no specific configuration parameters for this mode


# Single Sign-On - gitea mode
#----------------------------

# Set the Gitea server domain to be used for the project - for example git.{{project_domain_name}}
# This should be the domain configured in the ryo-gitea configuration
project_idp_gitea_domain_name: <SUBDOMAIN>.<DOMAIN>

# Add an OAuth2 application from the Gitea administrator account
# (configured in the ryo-gitea project)
# Add the Client ID and Client Secret provided by Gitea during this process here
project_idp_gitea_client_id: <CLIENT-ID>
project_idp_gitea_client_secret: <CLIENT-SECRET>
