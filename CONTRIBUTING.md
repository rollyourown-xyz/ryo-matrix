# Contributing

Thank you for taking an interest in collaborating with us on the rollyourown project!

Code and content of the rollyourown.xyz project is stored in our public repositories and collaboration is organised around these. We use the Issue tracking features to raise, discuss and track ideas, feature requests and bugs. We use forking and pull requests to manage changes to code and content.

## How to contribute

We would be delighted if you would like to contribute and there are a number of ways you can collaborate on the project.

### Raising security-related issues

If you have found a security vulnerability in any rollyourown.xyz service or any of the rollyourown.xyz projects, modules or other repositories, please report it via our [security vulnerability report form](https://forms.rollyourown.xyz/security-vulnerability).

For more information, see [our guide for raising security vulnerabilities](https://rollyourown.xyz/collaborate/security_vulnerabilities/).

### Contributing bug reports, feature requests and ideas

Report a bug or suggest an improvement for this project via the [Issues](https://rollyourown.xyz/collaborate/bug_reports_feature_requests_ideas/#raising-an-issue). Before submitting an issue, please search the existing issues in case the topic has already been addressed.

In case of general feedback and ideas for rollyourown.xyz that are not specific to this or a different project or module, please use the Issues in the general feedback repository [on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/rollyourown-xyz/general-feedback/issues) or [on GitHub](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz/general-feedback/issues).

Feedback to a different project or module should be submitted in the applicable repository.

For more information, see [our guide to contributing bug reports, feature requests and ideas](https://rollyourown.xyz/collaborate/bug_reports_feature_requests_ideas/).

### Pull Requests

If you would like to improve the code yourself, please first submit an [Issue](https://rollyourown.xyz/collaborate/bug_reports_feature_requests_ideas/#raising-an-issue) describing what you would like to change and why.

The project maintainer can then provide feedback on the proposal in advance of you doing any work. There may be a reason why your proposal would not be accepted, or should be realised differently, so this avoids you doing work which will end up not being accepted and merged into the code.

If, after discussing the change, you would like to proceed and implement it, then please fork this repository and submit a Pull Request. Please follow the workflow described on our website in [our guide to Forking and Pull Requests](https://rollyourown.xyz/collaborate/working_with_git/forking_and_pull_requests/).

## Licensing

We use [Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX)](https://spdx.dev/) licensing and copyright information in each source file in our repositories. We request any contributor to add SPDX information to any new file submitted and to include additional copyright information in modified files, where applicable.

In addition, when submitting a Pull Request to our project we ask contributors to agree with the terms of the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) to certify that the contributor has the right to make the contribution to our project. As well as ticking the checkbox in the Pull Request template, we recommend signing off each commit. To do this, configure your Git username and email address for the repository with:

```console
git config user.name "<USERNAME>"
git config user.email "<EMAIL ADDRESS>"
```

or globally with:

```console
git config --global user.name "<USERNAME>"
git config --global user.email "<EMAIL ADDRESS>"
```

Signoff is then automatic when using the `-s` flag with the `git commit` command.
