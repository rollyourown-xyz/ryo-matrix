# Contributing

Thank you for taking an interest in collaborating with us on the [rollyourown.xyz](https://rollyourown.xyz) project!

Code and content of the rollyourown.xyz project is stored in our public repositories and collaboration is organised around these. We use the Issue tracking features to raise, discuss and track ideas, feature requests and bugs. We use forking and pull requests to manage changes to code and content.

## How to contribute

We would be delighted if you would like to contribute and there are a number of ways you can collaborate on the project.

### Raising security-related issues

If you have found a security vulnerability in any rollyourown.xyz service or any of the rollyourown.xyz projects, modules or other repositories, please report it via our [security vulnerability report form](https://forms.rollyourown.xyz/security-vulnerability).

For more information, see [our guide for raising security vulnerabilities](https://rollyourown.xyz/collaborate/security_vulnerabilities/).

### Contributing bug reports, feature requests and ideas

Report a bug or suggest an improvement for this project via the [Issues](https://rollyourown.xyz/collaborate/bug_reports_feature_requests_ideas/#raising-an-issue). Before submitting an issue, please search the existing issues in case the topic has already been addressed.

In case of general feedback and ideas for rollyourown.xyz that are not specific to this or a different project or module, please use the Issues in the general feedback repository [on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/rollyourown-xyz/general-feedback/issues) or [on GitHub](https://github.com/rollyourown-xyz/general-feedback/issues).

Feedback to a different project or module should be submitted in the applicable repository.

For more information, see [our guide to contributing bug reports, feature requests and ideas](https://rollyourown.xyz/collaborate/bug_reports_feature_requests_ideas/).

### Pull Requests

If you would like to improve the code yourself, please first submit an [Issue](https://rollyourown.xyz/collaborate/bug_reports_feature_requests_ideas/#raising-an-issue) describing what you would like to change and why.

The project maintainer can then provide feedback on the proposal in advance of you doing any work. There may be a reason why your proposal would not be accepted, or should be realised differently, so this avoids you doing work which will end up not being accepted and merged into the code.

If, after discussing the change, you would like to proceed and implement it, then please fork this repository and submit a Pull Request. Please follow the workflow described on our website in [our guide to Forking and Pull Requests](https://rollyourown.xyz/collaborate/working_with_git/forking_and_pull_requests/).
