# Security Policy

Your ethical disclosure of any security vulnerability will be highly appreciated and we ask you to follow the practice of [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) when raising potential security vulnerabilities in rollyourown.xyz services, projects or modules.

## Reporting security vulnerabilities

If you have found a security vulnerability in any rollyourown.xyz service or any of the rollyourown.xyz projects, modules or other repositories, please report this via our [security vulnerability report form](https://forms.rollyourown.xyz/security-vulnerability).

Security issues in software deployed by a [rollyourown.xyz](https://rollyourown.xyz) [project](https://rollyourown.xyz/rollyourown/projects/) or [module](https://rollyourown.xyz/rollyourown/project_modules/) should be reported directly to the applicable open source project. Links to the homepages of the software deployed can be found in the "Software deployed" section on each of the [project](https://rollyourown.xyz/rollyourown/projects/) or [module](https://rollyourown.xyz/rollyourown/project_modules/) pages. If in doubt, or if you have found no way to report a security issue confidentially in these cases, please contact us via our [security vulnerability report form](https://forms.rollyourown.xyz/security-vulnerability).
